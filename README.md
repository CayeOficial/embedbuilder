# An embed visualizer

Visualize embed or message content from JSON input or provided GUI editor.

This can be used for discord bot embed commands. It can also be intergreted into your Discord bot's website.  

Aside the JSON editor, it also includes a GUI editor which converts to JSON for simplicity.
