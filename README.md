# A embed visualizer

![Layout image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Glitchii/embedbuilder/master/assets/media/layout.png)

Visualizes embed or message content from JSON input.  
This can be used for bot embed commands commands, although I understand that not every one understands JSON thus will add a GUI later.  
You can look into the [project boards](https://github.com/Glitchii/embedbuilder/projects/3) if you want to see what I'm currently working on or want to contribute
