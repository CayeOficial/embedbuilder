# An embed visualizer

Displays embed or message content from JSON input. This can be used for visualizing bot embed commands.  

This can be used for bot embed commands commands, although I understand that not every one understands JSON thus will add a GUI later.  
You can look into the [project boards](https://github.com/Glitchii/embedbuilder/projects/3) if you want to see what is being worked on or want to contribute.
